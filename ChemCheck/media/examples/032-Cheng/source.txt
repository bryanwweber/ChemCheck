Abstract: Abstract
Depletion and overconsumption of the traditional fossil fuels necessitate the searching of renewable energies and alternative fuels. With its similar properties to those of gasoline, 2-methylfuran (MF) can be used as an alternative fuel or fuel additive directly in the engines. In this work, low-pressure laminar premixed MF/O2/Ar flames with equivalence ratios of 0.80, 1.00, and 1.50 were studied to investigate the flame structure of MF. Synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet photoionization mass spectrometry was used for the measurements of the mole fractions of the flame species. A revised MF mechanism based on that of Somers et al. was used to analyze the reaction pathways of MF, combining the formation and consumption reactions of some key species, such as 2-furylmethyl, propargyl, 1-oxo-1,3,4-pentatriene, 1-oxo-1,3-butadiene, acrolein, and methyl vinyl ketone, etc. The current mechanism may well predict the H-addition products of MF, i.e., 1-oxo-1,3-butadiene and furan, but under-estimate the H-abstraction products of MF, i.e., 2-furylmethyl and 1-oxo-1,3,4-pentatriene. As to the OH-addition products of MF, acrolein and methyl vinyl ketone, the former one is over-predicted. This can be improved by addressing the effect of the MF structure on the OH-addition reactions, taking into account both formation and consumption of these two species.
